## 🌟 Open Source Contributions

The major goal of this program is to contribute meaningfully to Bitcoin open-source projects. Participants will:

- 🔄 Learn Git workflow and best practices
- 📤 Create and submit Pull Requests
- 👁️ Participate in code reviews
- 📖 Read and understand BIPs
- 💬 Join Bitcoin Core Review Club discussions
- 🤝 Collaborate with global Bitcoin developers
- 💰 Explore grant opportunities for active contributors

### Open Source Etiquette

- Follow project contribution guidelines
- Write clear commit messages
- Engage constructively in code reviews
- Respect maintainers' time and decisions

---


##  Capstone Project

All participants will complete a capstone project demonstrating their skills and knowledge gained throughout the program.

### Project Options

- **Bitcoin Wallet** - Full-featured wallet implementation
- **Lightning Tool** - Lightning Network utility or application
- **Bitcoin CLI** - Command-line interface for Bitcoin operations
- **Bitcoin Indexer** - Blockchain data indexing and analysis
- **Transaction Explorer** - Transaction visualization and analysis
- **Block Explorer** - Blockchain block exploration interface
- **Wallet Library** - Reusable wallet functionality library

### This Submission

The capstone in this repository lives in [`Capstone/`](Capstone/) — a non-custodial
Bitcoin wallet used through a Telegram chat, with a `wallet-cli` front end over
the same `wallet-core` to prove the boundary holds. See
[`Capstone/README.md`](Capstone/README.md) for the architecture, security model
and setup.

### Final Deliverables

- 📦 GitHub Repository with complete source code
- 📖 Comprehensive README with documentation
- 🏗️ Architecture Diagram
- 🎥 Demo Video
- 🎤 Live Presentation during Demo Day
